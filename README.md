# Bunny Origin Protection (bop)

Lock your origin to bunny.net’s edge network with an automated, idempotent firewall sync.

`bop` fetches the current bunny.net edge server IPs and maintains a dedicated **iptables** chain that:
- **Allows** only those IPs to reach **TCP 443**
- **Drops** everything else to that port

It’s designed to be safe to re-run (e.g., via cron), and ships with a POSIX-`sh` installer that backs up your current firewall configuration so you can **cleanly uninstall/rollback** later.

## Features

- 🔐 Origin protection for **HTTPS (port 443)** via `iptables`

- 🧰 Works with both `iptables (legacy)` and `iptables-nft` frontends
- 🧪 One-liner install (**curl**/**wget** → `sh`)
- 🗓️ Optional cron refresh (e.g., every 10 minutes)
- 🧯 Safe rollback: iptables backups for uninstall
- 🐍 Python ≥ 3.7
